Hello again.

This time I'm writing this inside Linux, using sudo nano command.

I started Linux with a livestick (Try Xubuntu for free!) 15:15.

I did my rituals once again, which are writing setxkbmap fi to terminal to get the nordic letters (ä,å), and after that i did sudo apt-get update, to update my packages.

After doing these 2, I installed puppet with command sudo apt-get install puppet.

After installing puppet, i created my own module folder inside modules folder, by command sudo mkdir mymodule, and inside that folder, sudo mkdir manifests.

After creating manifests folder, I need to go one step back and create a folder called templates to mymodule.

Now it was time to do my very own alias! My alias idea is to bind letter "d" for ls.

First, i went to the path /etc/ to edit bash.bashrc, where the alias has to be written for me. So first i typed sudo nano bash.bashrc, and wrote alias d="ls", to the first line.

After that... i was lost for quite a long time. Gladly, i found a blog post about this very same homework and found my solutions.. My problem the content of my init.pp file,

which i made to the manifests file. (Link to the wordpress below in the references).

Boom! Found it!

class mymodule {

                file {'/etc/bash.bashrc':
                content => template('mymodule/bash.bashrc.erb')

        }


This were my paths, and now was the time to copy and paste the bash.bashrc renamed bash.bashrc.erb to my templates folder.

So.. to copy paste the bash.bashrc renamed, this was my command: sudo cp bash.bashrc /etc/puppet/modules/mymodule/templates/bash.bashrc.erb

Now if i want to try it out, i need to close my terminal and open a new one (I don't know why, but that's what seemed to work during earlier class). 

WORKS! Now if i press d, it shows all the folders in this path/destination.

xubuntu@xubuntu:~$ d
Desktop    Downloads  Music     Public     Videos
Documents  helloyael  Pictures  Templates
xubuntu@xubuntu:~$ 

This was by far the intense homework i've ever had in Linux.. I did these same things during earlier class, but i had totally forgotten these. I'm so glad and thankful that
Simo Suominen had posted his wordpress to our teacher's website, below the homework.

EDIT 16:27 : Forgot to tell that i added this homework from the terminal, writing git add ., and after that git commit. After commiting i make sure to git pull it first, and then
i push it, and it updates my github page.
