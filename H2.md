Hello again.

This time I'm writing this inside Linux, using sudo nano command.

I started Linux with a livestick (Try Xubuntu for free!) 15:15.

I did my rituals once again, which are writing setxkbmap fi to terminal to get the nordic letters (ä,å), and after that i did sudo apt-get update, to update my packages.

After doing these 2, I installed puppet with command sudo apt-get install puppet.

After installing puppet, i created my own module folder inside modules folder, by command sudo mkdir mymodule, and inside that folder, sudo mkdir manifests.
